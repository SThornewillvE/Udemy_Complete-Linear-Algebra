# Udemy Complete Linear Algebra

## Description

During my time working as a Junior Data Analyst, I was given access to Udemy for Business and I decided that I might learn a thing or do by working through a course on Linear Algebra.

Although I have some prior knowledge by watching the lectures on MIT Opencourseware for Linear Algebra (18.06), I want to try and apply and reinforce that learning by implementing things in code.

I feel as if when I was learning under strang, although I got a good intuition for linear algebra, I didn't practice rigorously enough for the learnings to be cemented as well as they could have been, which I'll try to rectify here.

Files are written as Jupyter Notebooks and are written primarily using Numpy.
